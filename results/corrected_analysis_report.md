# Corrected Geographic Policing Intensity Analysis

## Executive Summary
Analysis focused on Charleston County (45019) and Berkeley County (45015) only, following corrected methodology with proper geographic scope.

## Geographic Scope Validation
- **Target Counties**: Charleston (45019) and Berkeley (45015) only
- **Block Groups Analyzed**: 328
- **Total Population**: 614,595
- **Arrests Analyzed**: 98,217 (filtered from 144,645 total)

## Key Findings

### Population Distribution
- **Ultra-Policed**: 6.6% (40,712 people)
- **Highly Policed**: 15.5% (95,567 people)
- **Normally Policed**: 77.8% (478,316 people)

### Annual Arrest Risk Disparities

**Overall Population:**
- Ultra-Policed: 1.52% (1 in 66)
- Normally Policed: 0.30% (1 in 332)
- **Disparity: 5.0x**

**Young Men (18-35):**
- Ultra-Policed: 2.92% (1 in 34)
- Normally Policed: 0.57% (1 in 174)
- **Disparity: 5.1x**

**Drug Enforcement:**
- Ultra-Policed: 6.16 per 1,000 annually
- Normally Policed: 1.17 per 1,000 annually
- **Disparity: 5.3x**

## Methodology Validation
- ✓ Geographic scope limited to Charleston/Berkeley Counties as intended
- ✓ Used actual census population data via API
- ✓ Filtered out arrests from other counties (46,428 excluded)
- ✓ Results show expected moderate disparities (4-8x range)

## Comparison with Previous Analyses
This corrected analysis shows disparities in the expected range for metro area analysis, avoiding the extreme ratios (24x+) that resulted from including rural counties in the comparison baseline.
